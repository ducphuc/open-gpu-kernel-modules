# BAR1 policy tests

Run the source-level BAR1 P2P policy regression test with:

```sh
make -C tests check
```

The test verifies the runtime-coverage truth table. Display-aware placement is
available only when BAR1 P2P is enabled by the existing device property and
both the aligned client framebuffer and available static BAR1 window are
non-empty. Partial, exact, and larger-than-client coverage are accepted without
an implementation-specific exception.

It also verifies that the non-coherent DMA-BUF GDR path does not replace the
stock coherent path and requires an enabled policy, FORCE_PCIE, static BAR1,
and the existing BAR1/MIG exclusions. Its range checks cover inside, spanning,
outside, empty, and overflowing layouts.

The topology-policy test keeps the non-coherent importer exception limited to
an enabled policy, a Linux-approved P2PDMA path, an identity IOMMU domain, and
an importer DMA mask that covers the complete BAR1 resource. Each eligibility
predicate has an explicit negative case.
